Description: Generate, simulate and visualise ODE models of consumer-resource 
    interactions. At its core, rescomp provides a resource competition 
    modelling focused interface to deSolve, alongside flexible functions for 
    visualizing model properties and dynamics. More information, documention 
    and examples can be found on the package website.
