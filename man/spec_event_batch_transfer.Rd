\title{Define an event in which the species and resources are diluted by addition of new medium}
\usage{
spec_event_batch_transfer(dilution, resources)
}
\arguments{
\item{dilution}{A number (which should be between 0 and 1) representing the proportion of the original medium retained.}

\item{resources}{A numeric vector or \code{rescomp_coefs_vector} of resource concentrations.}
}
\value{
S3 object of class \code{rescomp_event}.
}
\description{
Produces an event object representing a batch transfer by dilution with new medium.
First, all existing species and resource concentrations are multiplied by \code{dilution}.
Then, the resource concentrations listed in \code{resources}, mutlipled by 1 - \code{dilution}, are added.
